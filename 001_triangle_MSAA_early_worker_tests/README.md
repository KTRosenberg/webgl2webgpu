# Modification of Tutorial Example, adding early tests with Web Workers and MSAA, VERY ROUGH
**Description**:
To run, download NodeJS (server for running locally) and execute init.sh or init.bat depending on platform (there will be differences later). Then execute run.sh or init.bat.
Toggle MSAA with the boolean flaf in index.html

# WebGL 2 WebGPU - 001 - Triangle
**Description**:
In this first video, We're going to break things down into distinct functions and show mirror examples
in WebGL and WebGPU. The areas are Init, Shader, Ubo, Mesh and Render. We'll learn how to setup each 
bit that we need to get a simple triangle rendered on screen.

KEEP IN MIND. WebGPU is still being developed as I write this, so the code contained here may break at 
some point when the api gets changed around. This happened in the middle of developing this first lesson :)
