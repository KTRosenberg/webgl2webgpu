# WebGL 2 WebGPU - Youtube Tutorial Series

**Purpose** :
This series is designed as a companion to my "Fun With WebGL 2" video series. The main 
series focuses on various topics related to building a game engine from scratch and all 
it's sub systems. This series will focus mostly on learning how to use the WebGPU API 
for rendering. With each lesson I plan to show both a WebGPU and WebGL2 
version of the same code to illustrate the differences and similarities between the
two graphic APIs. The idea is to help transition our WebGL 2 knowledge into something more
in tuned to WebGPU.

As a driver for the series, We'll work on creating an Abstraction layer that will allow us
to write a single 3D application with the ability to render to either API. The first being able
to animate a 3D Skinned mesh on either API. This will become an example of how to build a framework
that supports multiple graphic APIs.

This can lead to further developments using WebAssembly where we can port the framework to rust so 
we can have a single code base that is able to support 3D Graphics on the web plus extend graphics
support to handle a desktop API like Vulkan.
